# Power-BI---data-visualization-

## Introduction 
Ever wondered what it really takes to thrive as a data professional, or what skills are most in demand or even how difficult it is to break into data? This Power BI project dives deep into Alex the Analyst's comprehensive Data Professionals Survey to answer those very questions. This survey was collected by Alex the Analyst to ask data professionals about their different data roles and how life as a data professional has been ever since then.
